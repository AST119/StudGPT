# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # --- For Adaptive Icons (Android 8.0+): Highly Recommended ---
  # You need BOTH a background and a foreground image/color

  # Option 1: Background Color + Foreground Image
  adaptive_icon_background: "#FFFFFF"  # Hex color code for the background
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "lib/logo.png" # Path to foreground image (transparent background)

  # Option 2: Background Image + Foreground Image
  # adaptive_icon_background: "assets/images/logo_background.png" # Path to background image
  # adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/images/logo_foreground.png" # Path to foreground image (transparent background)

  # Option 3: Simpler - Use the main image_path for foreground and specify background color/image
  # adaptive_icon_background: "#FFFFFF"
  # image_path_android: "assets/images/logo_foreground.png" # If foreground differs from main logo

  # --- End Adaptive Icons ---
